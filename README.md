# Sentimental_Analysis

This is a project in which analysis of financial documents from the SEC website is done , which returns the uncertainty , polarity, complex words, positive score, negative score and several other variables .
<br/>
Objective:-  Objective of this assignment is to extract some sections from SEC / EDGAR financial reports and perform text analysis to compute variables which are given below:

<br/>
 output variables:

<br/>
All input variables in “cik_list.xlsx”<br/>
positive_score<br/>
negative_score<br/>
polarity_score<br/>
average_sentence_length<br/>
percentage_of_complex_words<br/>
fog_index<br/>
complex_word_count<br/>
word_count<br/>
uncertainty_score<br/>
constraining_score<br/>
positive_word_proportion<br/>
negative_word_proportion<br/>
uncertainty_word_proportion<br/>
constraining_word_proportion<br/>
constraining_words_whole_report<br/>

<br/>
In this ,the final code is attached through which I have generated the output and also a output.csv file in which the final results are stored .
<br/>
The final code consists of different functions through which I got positive , negative and all other required variables.
